# Functional Tools
A collection of useful utility functions to improve code scalability. If the language already has the tool in question, then the code highlights examples of it's usage. Otherwise, the code shows a function that replicates it's functionality.

# Why Functional Tools
Frequently, we have to manipulate things such arrays/lists, objects/dictionaries, etc. Therefore having already made tools for these tasks are very useful.

# Tools to be built/documented:
- Chunk Array: Split array into groups based on size parameter.
- Find values: Creates a new array based on values passed.
    - Note to self: Filter maybe useful for implementing this one.
- Sort By: Sorts array of elements based on factors pased.
    - Note to self: Look into sorting algorithms for possible help.
